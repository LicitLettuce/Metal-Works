## 1.0.0 INITIAL RELEASE
Metal Works is a vanilla-styled mod that adds three unique metals, each with their own distinct functions. Each metal serves a unique purpose and is designed to complement different playstyles — no metal is strictly superior to another. Depending on how you play, your hotbar might feature tools made from a mix of materials.

### Additions

#### Tin
- Found deep in the Overworld where Stone meets Deepslate.
- A common material with dense ore drops.
- Tin tools are weaker than Iron but lighter and faster, offering higher swing speed.
- Can be used to craft Tin Armor, tools, and a wide variety of decorative blocks:
- Cut Tin, Tin Shingles, Tin Grates
- Tin Doors & Trapdoors
- Tin Lanterns, larger than vanilla lanterns.

#### Bronze

- A sturdy alloy crafted with 4 Tin + 4 Copper in a crafting table.
- Bronze gear is a tier between Iron and Diamond:
  - Stronger than Iron, with longer durability.
  - Fire-resistant, like real-world bronze — doesn’t burn like Netherite.
  - Usable in both tools and decorative blocks:
- Bronze Shingles, Tiles, Grates, and Bars.

#### Rose Gold

- A shiny alloy crafted with 4 Gold + 4 Copper in a crafting table.
- Similar strength to Iron but with:
  - Higher efficiency
  - Better enchantability
  - Greater durability
- Rose Gold Nuggets + Beetroot = Rose Gold Beetroots, a food item superior to Golden Carrots.
- Can also be combined with Prismarine Crystals to craft Rose Lamps.
